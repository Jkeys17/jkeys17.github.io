# Chatroom Application

This chatroom application enables real-time text communication between users over a network. It consists of a server component that manages connections and message broadcasts, and a client component through which users send and receive messages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation

To get started with the chatroom application, follow these steps:
